# dotfiles

These are most of the configuration files I use on a daily basis.
I have started using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) via [mdm](https://sr.ht/~jcmuller/my-dotfiles-manager/), a tool I wrote to make dealing with `stow` a bit easier.

You're welcome to check out these configs and if you think something might be better, go ahead and send a patch!

Cheers
